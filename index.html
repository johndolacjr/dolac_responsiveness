                    My name is John Dolac and I was born in December 1983. I grew up in a miliatary family and moved
                    almost every three years of my life until I moved to Charlotte, NC in 2007. During my time as a
                    military brat, I lived in several states and one other country. In order, I was born in Fayettville,
                    NC and then moved to Germany, Indiana, Tennessee, Rhode Island, Virginia, Hawaii, Charlotte, NC, and
                    now Utah.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I joined the military in 2008 where I went to basic training in Fort Sill, Oklahoma and attended my
                    AIT at Ft. Leanordwood, MO. I have been in the Army Reserves for 12 years while working at
                    Avidxchange
                    which is a FINTECH company headquarted in Charlotte, NC. Avidxchange is the reason I moved out to
                    Utah as I was promoted to stand up our payment operations in SLC. It has been a great experience but
                    I
                    look forward to starting a new chapter in my life which is why I am taking this coding bootcamp
                    course.
                </p>

                <p> Once I moved out to SLC, UT my family and I fell in love with it. We love the outdoors and the fact
                    there
                    is virtually no humidity!! Since moving out west we have explored virtually all of the western
                    states except for
                    Oregon and Alaska (on the to do list...thanks a lot COVID!!). We aren't going to let the pandemic
                    slow us down as
                    we are looking forward to being able to find a job where we can work remotely and live on a
                    converted school bus
                    within the next year. From there we plan to really start exploring the USA and Canada.
                </p>
